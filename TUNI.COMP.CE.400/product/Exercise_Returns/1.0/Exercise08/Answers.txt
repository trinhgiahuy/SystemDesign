1. What is the most significant change in the profiling picture compared to the previous exercises?
- The function kvz_intra_recon_lcu_luma executing most of the time used within it (50.08%) comparing to function kvz_search_cu_intra (59.59%) in the previous profling picture. In addition,the executing time of function kvz_quantize_residual_trskip has increase significantly while this number decrease in function kvz_intra_predict. This profiling picture comprise some new functions such as kvz_videoframe_compute_psnr and kvz_threadqueue_waitfor. 	 

2. Fill the below table with performance measurements, using the parameters of the corresponding row.

3. Which parameters of the above table have the most significant impact on the performance of the system?
- The resolution of video play a most significant impact on the overall system performance. The less resolution used for streaming, the less latency and more FPS we could get.
    
4. Did you complete the bonus task? If you did, what is the significant change in quality of the video?
- No we did not.

5. What was hard? What was easy?
- The exercise instruction is quite clear and straightforward.However, this exercise requires our knowledge from all previous exercises to complete it successfully.
