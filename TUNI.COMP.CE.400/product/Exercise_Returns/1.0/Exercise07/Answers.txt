INCLUDE ANSWERS IN HERE

1. What was your frame rate when running Kvazaar with the IP accelerator? 
- The FPS is 0.15 when run Kvazaar with IP accelerator.

2. In exercise 5, you made some prediction about accelerated frame rate. It probably did not match the results of this exercise. Why?
- In exercise 5, the frame rate does not match because its FPS is calculated based on VM frame rate and relation accelerated which the measurement take places in theory.

3. On the other hand, the estimation done in exercise 6 was probably much closer. Why?
- The simulated FPS of the HW-accelerated version in Exercise 6 is 0.19 which is much closer since hardware_timed simulation calculation, we have take into account the time reading and writing from onchip FPGA to HPS vice versa and from FPGA to DDR that mapped from/to kernel space.

4. What problem does running the camera user application in continuous mode seem to cause in the  captured video?
HINT: The watermark is not caused by the continuous mode.
- There are noises appeared in the video before frame 11.

5. What was hard? What was easy?
- The exercise does not require much knowledge of system design. However, the creating Qsys component step consumes a lot of time for debugging when encouting error.

6. How many hours did the exercise take per person, including answering questions and any downtime?
   GROUP MEMBER 1: Quang 8:00
   GROUP MEMBER 2: Huy   10:00
