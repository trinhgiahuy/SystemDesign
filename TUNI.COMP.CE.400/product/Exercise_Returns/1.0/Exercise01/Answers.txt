1. What is the focus of the exercise project (=all exercises)? Why?
Hint: Read the exercise project summary from Moodle
Hint 2: Implementing a video encoder is NOT the focus of the exercises.

*** PART ONE ***

Some of the questions may involve examining the txt-files generated while encoding.

2. How much time did the encoding take? Look at the "Total CPU time".

	QP 50:
	GROUP QP: 

3. How many frames were encoded per second (FPS)?

	QP 50:
	GROUP QP:

4. How did decreasing the quantization value affect perceived quality of the video output?

5. How did decreasing the quantization value affect size of the video output file?

7. What was average PSNR?

	QP 50:
	GROUP QP:

8. What was the data compression ratio of encoding using your assigned quantization value?
Data compression ratio is defined as (size of the video input file)/(size of the video output file).

	QP 50:
	GROUP QP:

*** PART TWO ***

9. What was average PSNR of the profiling run?

10. What does parameter -pg do in GCC? How it affects the resulting executable and its execution?

11. Which three (3) functions use most time in Kvazaar? Answer based on the time used by functions
alone, not by the functions they call.

12. Why it is better to look at percentages rather than absolute time like seconds or milliseconds while
using a profiling tool (like gprof)?

13. Which function would you choose for hardware acceleration? If there are multiple good candidates, choose one.

14. What does that function do? Why do you think it's a good candidate for hardware acceleration?
Mention at least two reasons.
Hint: Look at the source code at Kactus2 location TUNI.fi->ip.sw->Kvazaar->0.7.2->src

15. How are you feeling? What was hard? What was easy?
