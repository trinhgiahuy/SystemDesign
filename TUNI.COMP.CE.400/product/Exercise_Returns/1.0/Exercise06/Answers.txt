INCLUDE ANSWERS IN HERE

1. Did you get similar results simulating Kvazaar on ARM? What was the simulated FPS for Kvazaar on ARM?

Yes, the simulated FPS for SW is 0.08.

2. What were your values for delay_c, search_intra_rough_percentage_c, rest_percentage_c?

delay_c = 17000
search_intra_rough_percentage_c = 0.5820
rest_percentage_c = 0.4064

3. What was the simulated FPS of the HW-accelerated version?

The simulated FPS of the HW-accelerated version is 0.19.

4. How was the computation time/delay added to the simulation on both ARM simulation and HW-accelerated simulation? What function/s, variable/s, and calculations are used?

-- SW simulation (ARM):
The delay is added through function "search_intra_rough_delay" in "search_intra.c" (line 386). The added delay is width*delay_c*search_intra_rough_percentage_c = width * 17000 * 0.5820, with "width" is the width of the prediction block. The function "search_intra_rough_delay" is defined in "search_intra_supplement.c", where Kvazaar instance ip_acc_driver passes the delay to calculation via function "delay_ns" in "sc_kvazaar.c". This delay is accumulated in "intra_rough_search_time" variable to compute the simulation time. The SW model uses both "intra_rough_search_time" and "rest_of_the_encoder" (defined next) to calculate the delay, which yields longer simulation time compared to HW-accelerated.

-- HW simulation:
The delay is added through function "search_intra" in "search_intra.c" (line 683). The added delay is cu_width*delay_c*rest_percentage_c = cu_width * 17000 * 0.4064. The function "search_intra" is also defined in "search_intra_supplement.c", where Kvazaar instance ip_acc_driver passes the delay to calculation via function "delay_ns" in "sc_kvazaar.c". This delay is accumulated in "rest_of_the_encoder" to give the simulation time. The HW simulation uses only this "rest_of_the_encoder" variable.

5. Do you think the computation time/delay is calculated accurately enough?
		
6. How do we know the improvement we got with the HW accelerator is correct?

7. How many data transfers happened and how much data was sent and read while simulating the HW-accelerated version?

8. What percentages did you get for search_intra_rough/(HW-accelerator and transfers) and for the rest of the encoder, simulating Kvazaar on ARM and simulating the HW-accelerated version?

# Transfers to/from HW   :       0.01 %                       #
# Intra rough search HW  :       0.01 %                       #
# Rest of the encoder    :       0.98 %                       #

9. What does using wait() in delay_ns() cause?

It increases the simulation time.

10. By looking at the two different waveforms, what kind of problems not using wait() causes?

11. What were your values for ARM_USED_CORES, arm_overclock_mhz_c, NUMBER_OF_ACCS and FPGA_FREQ_MHZ that achieved full HD real time encoding?

ARM_USED_CORES     : 96
arm_overclock_mhz_c: 1250
NUMBER_OF_ACCS     : 112
FPGA_FREQ_MHZ      : 287

=> FPS = 25.22
