INCLUDE ANSWERS IN HERE

SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE FAIRLY SPECULATIVE, AS THE SYSTEM IS
ESSENTIALLY A GREYBOX: THERE ARE DIAGRAMS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND KNOWN PRACTICES,
BUT THE PRECISE IMPLEMENTATION IS OBSCURE.

*** TRANSFER RATES ***

1. Insert all benchmarking results here.

2. How fast were the DMA write and read measured by the application and how fast were they actually (show calculations and differences)? Give a reason for this?

	WRITE ON SIGNAL TAP:
	DIFFERENCE TO APPLICATION MEASUREMENT:

	READ ON SIGNAL TAP:
	DIFFERENCE TO APPLICATION MEASUREMENT:
	
	REASON:

3. Did you mark the measurement points to the hardware designs as instructed?

*** MEMORY ***

4. How much memory the operating system on ARM sees available? How much the ARM processor really has?

	MEMORY FOR ARM:
	MEMORY FOR OPERATING SYSTEM:

*** MIPS ***

5. What was the calculated MIPS of the FPGA and the virtual machine CPU?
INSERT THE COMPLETE CALCULATIONS! TELL THE USED FREQUENCY OF THE CPU!

	FPGA MIPS:
	VIRTUAL MACHINE CPU MIPS:

6. What was the measured MIPS of the ARM CPU and the virtual machine CPU?

	MEASURED ARM MIPS:
	MEASURED VIRTUAL MACHINE CPU MIPS:

7. For CPUs, MIPS was measured in this exercise. Why this gives us a value differing from calculated MIPS?

8. What is probably the most important thing that the used MIPS measurements did not take into account?
HINT: We told you the answer in the instructions, but we are just making sure you understand.

*** SPECULATIVE FRAME RATE ***

9. How much were the speculative frame rates?
INSERT THE COMPLETE CALCULATIONS! TELL THE USED FRAME RATE!

	HARDWARE ACCELERATED FPS:
	PURE SOFTWARE FPS:

10. Why did we assume that roughly 60% of the execution was on the FPGA rather than the ARM CPU?
HINT: Look at the profiling results of exercise 1, or instructions of exercise 3.
	
*** BOGOMIPS ***

11. What was the BogoMIPS of the ARM CPU andthe virtual machine CPU?

	ARM BOGO MIPS:
	VIRTUAL MACHINE BOGO MIPS:
	
12. Why BogoMIPS is not so good measurement for performance? Find out if you do not know.
	
*** KVAZAAR ON ARM ***
	
13. What was the processor utilization percentage and the memory usage of Kvazaar?

	PROCESSOR UTILIZATION:
	MEMORY USAGE:

14. How Kvazaar performed on the ARM CPU in comparison to work station? Do the profiling pictures look similar?
HINT: Compare the FPS to earlier exercises, since the CPU times are not comparable because of the frame limit.

	NON-PROFILING FPS:
	DIFFERENCE TO WORKSTATION: ( NON-PROFILING FPS / WORKSTATION FPS ) = ?
	PROFILING FPS:
	ANALYSIS ON PICTURES:

15. How Kvazaar performed in comparison to the speculated software frame rate? What could be a reason for the difference?

	NON-PROFILING FPS:
	SPECULATED PURE SOFTWARE FPS:
	REASON:

16. What was hard? What was easy?
