FPGA image (RBF and SOF) for memory benchmarking is located in TUNI.fi:product:Terasic.Veek.Measurements

Benchmarking software+driver is located in SW component TUNI.fi:ip.sw:ARM_FPGA_memory_benchmarker

SignalTapII file is located in TUNI.fi:product:Terasic.Veek.Measurements
for more accurate speed for DMAs, otherwise benchmarker will print out results

Now compile the network measurement executables, the components coming to HPS side, "TCPMeasTalker" and "UDPMeasTalker",
are compiled same way as "ARMLinuxMeasRunner", except they will require flags "-pthread -lrt" for linking.

You must also compile software for the PC. The needed project files should come with the repository. Open as a project with
Visual Studio 2010 the files pointed in components "TCPMeasListener" and "UDPMeasListener". Build the projects.

To measure TCP performance, run first "TCPMeasListener" and then "TCPMeasTalker". Both applications should print text if they are working,
although text output will pause for duration of measurements. Then "TCPMeasTalker" will print the results.

To measure UDP performance, run first "UDPPMeasListener" and then "UDPMeasTalker". Both applications should print text if they are working,
although text output will pause for duration of measurements. Then "UDPMeasTalker" will print the results.

To measure ping from HPS to PC, type  "ping 192.168.0.1 -c 16 -s 36" to command line of the PC
To measure ping from PC to HPS, type "ping 192.168.0.1 -n 16" to commandline of the ARM.
